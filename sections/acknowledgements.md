# Acknowledgement

The past few weeks were enjoyable, fulfilling and enlightening.  Besides levelling up as a web developer, and gaining experience in inter-platform (embedded) development, the following people have contributed greatly to mentoring the project.  They are:

**Jos Flores** My mentor, who was instrumental in bringing the team together, giving advice and advising us to listen to the community's needs instead of jumping into the code straight.  He was a great and patient teacher, never discounting any question, 
despite his busy schedule. 

He got me up and running with Git, and through him I have learnt much about the App Inventor workflow, and constributing to the 
codebase - something that would have taken a considerable longer time had he not been present.

**Prof. Ben Leong** Our course instructor, who provided us with considerable advice that agurs well beyond the scope of this program.

I recall his ancedotes as a programmer, never failing to give up but more importantly, re-examining the process of learning and making 
corrections where possible, in addition to the importance of estimating our code speed given the timeframe.  He has a heart and
passion for teaching, which clearly inspired the whole team.

**The community** The community, for giving ever needed timely advice and support during the development.  Their willingness to help 
on a voluntary project attests to their passion for contributing to App Inventor, as well as helping beginners get involved in code
through education (learning via code blocks).
