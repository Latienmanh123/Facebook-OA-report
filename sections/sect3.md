# Facebook OA / AI2 – Week 3 (February 11 – February 18)

I spent the first part of the week catching up with leftover labs and school assignments. I have also migrated my development to IntelliJ instead of Eclipse and it is working much better. Instead of configuring stuff, now more is done by the IDE and this eases my development with working on the large code base.

For this week, I proposed on the forum of moving development to a Docker container. This would make development easier via a single command, instead of running multiple commands in multiple terminal windows as we have to do now. Right now it is not as pressing and am leaving it as a suggestion to the community to develop it.
