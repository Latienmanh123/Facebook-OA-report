# Facebook OA / AI2 – Week 5 (February 25 – March 4)

For this week, I had a disussion with my mentor Jose about what we should implement for Phaser.

Originally, we discussed about implementing Phaser as-is, using blocks and building a separate add-on. This was submitted as Version 1 of the API. However, Jose cautioned against doing that and instead asking me questions about:

> What do you really like to see being carried forward?
> 
> Think from the perspective of the user, a person who might just have had his first experience with programming.

He advised that instead of coding a solution, on roadmap should be instead listening to the user, drafting a proposal to the Open-Source community, create something fast and sketchy, and find out what they think about it. Then, improve and refactor later, add more new features later.

I found this to be really insightful and proceeded to follow his advice.

The week was spent playing around with Blockly factory, drafting a proposal and mocking components and thinking *what* should *really* developed, and what I would like to see in the game.

There are many types of games for example:

*   Top-level games
*   RPG
*   RTS
*   Arcade

I came to the conclusion that given our need for a certain degree of flexibility, we have to restrain our implementation to a certain type of game. And for this, we chose the **arcade** game type which is really fun to explore, to develop as a phone app, and really interesting for end-users to view.

So here's how the working spec proposal (Version 2 of the API) looks like on Google Docs! And we received some feedback here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jcZ3FNsjMZPQVVCyaKAmAktT3MKZLapE3XMJdrMfM9U/edit?usp=sharing

## Next steps

Am really happy with the feedback and will proceed to implement the basics of the features.
